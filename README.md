### Bot Description:
A discord bot which will prevent your server from being nuked/wizzed through checking logs as fast as it can to get the unauthorised user and ban them.

Database: `JSON`.

### Requirements:
1. [Node.JS LTS Version](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
2. Code Editor: VSC(recommended), Sublime, Atom etc.
3. OS: Windows, macOS.

### Protection Features:
* `Protection From Unathorised Bans.`
* `Protection From Unathorised Kicks.`
* `Protection From Unathorised Role Creation.`
* `Protection From Unathorised Passing of potential dangerous permissions.`
* `Protection From Unathorised Adding of a bot.`
