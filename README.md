# Requirements Before Set-up:

1. [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
2. Code Editor: VSC(recommended), Sublime, Atom etc.

# Set-up: Bot

1. Go to your [Discord Developers Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new bot | You can use an existing one.
2. Go to the "Bot" section and scroll down till you see "Privileged Gateway Intents".
3. Select both **Presence Intent** and **Server Members Intent**.

### Example

![intents](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/782211920416735252/789810856460419092/unknown.png?width=1409&height=400)

# Set-up: Script

1. Run the `Launch` file and it will install npm then wait for all the packages to be installed.
1. Right click on the `settings.json` file.
2. Open the file either on Notepad or a code editor i.e VSC (Visual Studio Code).
3. Fill in ALL the gaps.
4. Save.

### Example

![settings](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/818734089724493855/819660501964685342/unknown.png)

### `settings.json`: Objects Explained

* `prefix` |`string`| Your Bot Prefix.
* `token` |`string`| Your Bot Token.
* `founder` |`string`| Your Discord Tag.
* `founderId` |`string`| Your Discord User ID.
* `author` |`string`| My Discord Tag. **(Do not remove.)**
* `authorID` |`string`| My Discord User ID. **(Do not remove.)**
* `github` |`string`| My Github Profile. **(Do not remove.)**
* `sourceCode` |`string`| Anti Nuke Source Code. **(Do not remove.)**
* `inviteLink` |`string`| Your Bot Invite link. (Admin required.)
* `SupportServer` |`string`| A server of your choice. 
* `AllowGuilds` |`bool`| Permission for bot to be used in different servers. Default set to `false`.
* `LockGuildID` |`string`| A server where your bot will soley operate in. (If `AllowGuilds` is set to true this is inefective.)
* `PermittedGuilds` |`Array`| An array of servers you'd like the bot to operate in.

## Why your bot keeps leaving:

*The guild which you invited the bot or trying to run a command in is not whitelisted.*

if: `AllowGuilds` is set to `false`

- You can only add **one** guild ID to the `LockGuildID` object.

if: `AllowGuilds` is set to `true`

- You can add multiple guild ID's to the `PermittedGuilds` Array
- If your previous guild ID which is in `LockGuildID` is not in `PermittedGuilds` add it so it wont leave the server.

## Start-up:

1. Run the `run.bat` file.

# Things to note:

- Your bot must first be allocated a guild. You can do this by setting your server ID to the `LockGuild` object in the `Commands/settings.json` file.
- If you want the bot to be added to other servers you must enable guilds. **The server your bot joins must be permitted/whitelisted before joining or it will leave.**
- If a command is ran on a non-permitted guild, the bot will leave.
- The trust system allows a user to add/remove guilds, blacklist/whitelist users, enable/disable guilds. **They cannot allocate of users to the trust system. Give this permission to the people you trust the most.**
- Whitelisted and Trusted users are not effected by the anti nuke. They will not be banned.
- Blacklisted users are unable to join the guild(s) the bot is in.
- Once you enable guilds (can be done by setting the `AllowGuilds` object to true), make sure you add your `lockGuild` ID to the `PermittedGuilds` Array for every command to function.

### Examples

| Blacklisted User Attempt to join server | Unauthorised Ban |

# Disclaimer

This tool is designed for private use. It's meant to protect your server alone. Better suited for **one** server. Blacklisting, Trust and Whitelisting will not differ from each server your bot will be in.
